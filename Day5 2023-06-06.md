   #ARRAY
   1> "Earth-shattering" is an idiomatic expression used to describe something that is extremely important or significant, often implying that it has a large impact or influence. It suggests that something is so significant that it could cause the earth to shake or tremble. For example, "The discovery of a cure for cancer would be an earth-shattering breakthrough in the medical field."

   2> "Flaky" is an adjective used to describe something that is unreliable or inconsistent. It can be used to describe a person, product, or process that fails to work as expected or consistently produces unpredictable or varying results. For example, "The software has been acting flaky lately, crashing unexpectedly and producing inconsistent results.

3> 4 basic ways of using data structures:

- Read
- Search
- Insert
- Delete

> when we measure how “fast” an operation takes, we do not refer to how fast the operation takes in terms of pure time, but instead in how many steps it takes.

1. A computer can jump to any memory address in one step. (Think of this as driving to 123 Main Street—you can drive there in one trip since you know exactly where it is.)
2. Recorded in each array is the memory address which it begins at. So the computer has this starting address readily.
3. Every array begins at index 0.

--> Reading from an array actually takes just _one step_. This is because the computer has the ability to jump to any particular index in the array and peer inside.

--> search operation—in which the computer checks each cell one at a time—is known as _linear search_.

For N cells in an array, linear search will take a maximum of N steps.

--> insertion in a worst-case scenario can take _up to N + 1 steps_ for an array containing N elements. This is because the worst-case scenario is inserting a value into the beginning of the array in which there are N shifts (every data element of the array) and one insertion.

--> delete for an array containing N elements, the maximum number of steps that deletion would take is _N steps_.

#SET
A set is a data structure that does not allow duplicate values to be contained within it.

--> Reading from a set is exactly the same as reading from an array—it takes just one step for the computer to look up what is contained within a particular index

--> Insertion, the computer first needs to determine that this value doesn’t already exist in this set—because that’s what sets do: they prevent duplicate data. So every insert first requires a search.
