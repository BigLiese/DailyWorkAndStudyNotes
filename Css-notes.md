#"transform: translate(-50%, -50%)"

"transform: translate(-50%, -50%)" is a 2D transform that moves an element horizontally and vertically to the left and up half its width and height. Because the center of the element is positioned with the upper-left corner of the element as the reference point, not the center point of the element.

Specifically, "-50%" represents half the width or height of the element itself, while the minus sign "-" moves the element to the left or up. Therefore, the effect of "translate(-50%, -50%)" is to center align the element, regardless of its width and height. Move half the width and height of the element itself to the left and up, so that the center point of the element coincides with the center point of the parent element, achieving full center alignment.

Typically, this code is used to center and align absolutely positioned elements, for example:

```jsx
   position: absolute;
   top: 50%;
   left: 50%;
   transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

```
