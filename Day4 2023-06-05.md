1. Today, I learned how to set the initial state of a match in the state.ts file and used it to display the state by matching it with the state value in the API data on the precision recommendation page. I also learned how to create a popup when hovering over an element using the :hover pseudo-class.

```
<a href="#" class="popup-link">Click me for popup</a>

<div class="popup">This is the popup content</div>

   .popup-link {
  // 样式规则

  &:hover {
    // :hover 伪类样式规则
    position: relative;
    .popup {
      display: block; // 显示弹出窗口
    }
  }
}

.popup {
  display: none; // 隐藏弹出窗口
  position: absolute;
  top: 100%;
  left: 0;
}

```

The code provided shows an example of how to create a popup using CSS. The .popup-link element is the element that triggers the popup when hovered over, and the .popup element is the content of the popup. The .popup element is initially hidden with display: none;, but is displayed when the .popup-link element is hovered over using the :hover pseudo-class.

2. Yesterday, I downloaded several vocabulary apps to learn Japanese and Spanish. Today, I continued to learn 20 words in each language.

3. I started practicing algorithm problems and reading the book "Grokking Algorithms". Today, I solved an algorithm problem related to arrays.

4. I connected with 10 people on LinkedIn, bringing my total connections to 39. I will continue to work hard!

- "At any rate" is a common phrase in English that is used to indicate that the speaker is either changing the subject or returning to the main point of a discussion. It can also be used to indicate that the speaker is uncertain about a particular fact or detail and wants to move on to a different topic.
