1. Learned some new things from a colleague's code and started using them on my own page.
2. Updated my LinkedIn certificate and connected with a new person.
3. Took a LinkedIn git test and failed twice, and started the course above.

here's some thing I learned

window.open('/') and this.$router.push({ path: '/' }) are both used for navigation in web applications, but they have some important differences in terms of how they work and what they're used for.

window.open('/') opens a new window or tab in the browser and loads the content of the URL specified in the argument (in this case, "/"). This method is typically used to open a new browser window or tab to display a new page or resource, such as a PDF file or an external website. This method returns a reference to the new window or tab, which can be used to interact with the new window or tab programmatically.

this.$router.push({ path: '/' }) is used in the context of a Vue.js application to navigate to a new route within the application. The $router object is provided by Vue Router, which is a routing library for Vue.js applications. The push method of the $router object takes an argument that specifies the new route to navigate to. In this case, the argument is an object with a path property that specifies the path of the new route (in this case, "/").

One key difference between window.open('/') and this.$router.push({ path: '/' }) is that the former opens a new window or tab in the browser, while the latter navigates to a new route within the same window or tab. This means that window.open('/') canpotentially open multiple windows or tabs, depending on how it's used, while this.$router.push({ path: '/' }) will always navigate within the same window or tab.

Another important difference is that this.$router.push({ path: '/' }) is specifically designed for use in Vue.js applications with Vue Router, while window.open('/') is a general-purpose method that can be used in any web application. this.$router.push({ path: '/' }) is more tightly integrated with the Vue.js application and can take advantage of features like route guards and navigation hooks, which allow you to control and customize the navigation behavior of your application.

In summary, window.open('/') is used to open a new window or tab in the browser and load the content of a URL, while this.$router.push({ path: '/' }) is used to navigate to a new route within a Vue.js application using Vue Router. They have different use cases and behaviors, and it's important to choose the right method for your specific needs.
